âœ¨ I'm currently a second-year master student pursuing an M.S. in Data Science at NYU. I believe I'm a passionate data scientist with a strong technical foundation and diverse industry experience. At NYU, I specialize in machine learning, NLP, time series analysis, and neural networks, with hands-on expertise in Python, R, SQL, and Big Data tools. My journey began at UNC Chapel Hill, where I graduated with Highest Distinction in Computer Science & Statistics, gaining a lot of practical experience in data analysis, modeling, and engineering.

ðŸ‘€ I thrive at the intersection of technical implementation and strategic communication, and my goal is to use data-driven solutions to solve complex real-world problems.

ðŸ“Œ Professionally, I've delivered impactful projects across consulting, finance, and healthcare, leveraging AI and machine learning to solve complex problems:
- **CVS Health:** Led a Generative AI project to automate data extraction, enhancing claims processing accuracy.
- **Citadel:** Optimized trade monitoring using neural network models and built dashboards for compliance efficiency.
- **Deloitte:** Developed ML-powered customer segmentation to drive product improvements.

ðŸ“Œ Here, I showcase the exciting research projects Iâ€™ve contributed to during my graduate years in school: 
- [Convert Deck to CPT Codes: AI-Driven Reimbursement Code Discovery for Health Tech Startups](https://github.com/Archertakesitez/deck-to-CPT) | **Technologies:** Python, NLP, LLM, Web-design

  âš¡ Developed an AI-driven web application to streamline CPT code identification for HealthTech startups, leveraging NLP and machine learning to process user-uploaded documents and return the top five relevant CPT codes, aiming to simplify reimbursement processes.
- [A Spatial-Temporal GNN-Transformer Approach for Crop Yield Prediction](https://github.com/Tongyu-Zhao/GNN-Transformer) | **Technologies:** Python, Transformer, GNN

  âš¡ Developed a transformer + GNN machine learning framework to enhance crop yield prediction by leveraging geospatial and temporal data. This approach improves upon traditional RNN-based methods, capturing long-term dependencies and optimizing spatial-temporal modeling for agricultural planning in the face of climate change challenges.

- [Optimizing Surprisal Estimation in LLMs by Leveraging Sampling Methods](https://github.com/Glosolin/llm_surprisal_sample/) | **Technologies:** Python, NLP, LLM

  âš¡ Explored the impact of sampling methods on improving larger language models' ability to predict human reading times, achieving up to 194% improvement in surprisal estimate accuracy, and reaffirming the "larger is better" trend in NLP under optimized configurations.

- [Model Comparison for NYC Property Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/wangzes-kevo/nyc-property-sales-forecast) | **Technologies:** Python, Time Series Analysis

  âš¡ Developed and evaluated predictive models (SARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet) to forecast Monthly Aggregated Sales in the NYC real estate market, highlighting each model's strengths in capturing trends, seasonality, and nonlinear patterns, and offering actionable insights for real estate stakeholders.
