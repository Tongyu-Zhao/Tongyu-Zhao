✨I'm currently a second-year master student pursuing an M.S. in Data Science at NYU. I believe I'm a passionate data scientist with a strong technical foundation and diverse industry experience. At NYU, I specialize in machine learning, NLP, time series analysis, and neural networks, with hands-on expertise in Python, R, SQL, and Big Data tools. My journey began at UNC Chapel Hill, where I graduated with Highest Distinction in Computer Science & Statistics, gaining a lot of practical experience in data analysis, modeling, and engineering.

📌Professionally, I've delivered impactful projects across consulting, finance, and healthcare, leveraging AI and machine learning to solve complex problems:
- CVS Health: Led a Generative AI project to automate data extraction, enhancing claims processing accuracy.
- Citadel: Optimized trade monitoring using neural network models and built dashboards for compliance efficiency.
- Deloitte: Developed ML-powered customer segmentation to drive product improvements.

📌Here, I showcase the exciting research projects I’ve contributed to during my graduate years in school: 
- [Convert Deck to CPT Codes: AI-Driven Reimbursement Code Discovery for Health Tech Startups](https://github.com/Archertakesitez/deck-to-CPT) | **Technologies:** Python, NLP, LLM, Web-design

  ⚡Developed an AI-driven web application to streamline CPT code identification for HealthTech startups, leveraging NLP and machine learning to process user-uploaded documents and return the top five relevant CPT codes, aiming to simplify reimbursement processes.
- [A Spatial-Temporal GNN-Transformer Approach for Crop Yield Prediction](https://github.com/Archertakesitez/deck-to-CPT) | **Technologies:** Python, NLP, LLM, Web-design
